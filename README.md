# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

The data set that this code book pertains to is located in the `tidy_data.txt` file of this repository.

See the `README.md` file of this repository for background information on this data set.

The structure of the data set is described in the [Data](#data) section, its variables are listed in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the transformations that were carried out to obtain the data set based on the source data are presented in the [Transformations](#transformations) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables. 

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `activity`

	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing `Accelerometer`) were made in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing `Gyroscope`) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing `Magnitude`) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `timeDomain`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `frequencyDomain`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
1. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings `mean` and `std`) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
1. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see [Identifiers](#identifiers) section).
1. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` was expanded to `timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX`), using the following set of rules:
	- Special characters (i.e. `(`, `)`, and `-`) were removed
	- The initial `f` and `t` were expanded to `frequencyDomain` and `timeDomain` respectively.
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` were replaced with `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
	- Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's `features_info.txt` file) `BodyBody` with `Body`.
1. From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script (see `README.md` file for usage instructions).

# Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
- `tidy_data.txt`, which contains the data set.
- `CodeBook.md`, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
- `run_analysis.R`, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the [Creating the data set](#creating-data-set) section below) 

## Study design <a name="study-design"></a>

The source data set that this project was based on was obtained from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#), which describes how the data was initially collected as follows:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
> 
> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Training and test data were first merged together to create one data set, then the measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement (79 variables extracted from the original 561), and then the measurements were averaged for each subject and activity, resulting in the final data set.

## Creating the data set <a name="creating-data-set"></a>

The R script `run_analysis.R` can be used to create the data set. It retrieves the source data set and transforms it to produce the final data set by implementing the following steps (see the Code book for details, as well as the comments in the script itself):

- Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
- Read data.
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Write the data set to the `tidy_data.txt` file.

The `tidy_data.txt` in this repository was created by running the `run_analysis.R` script using R version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) on Windows 8.1 64-bit edition.

This script requires the `dplyr` package (version 0.4.3 was used).
